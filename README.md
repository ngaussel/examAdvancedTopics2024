## Instructions

This project will serve to evaluate students for the “Advanced Topics in Financial Modelling” class. Only students who have signed at least one presence sheet before March 22^{nd} can submit.

The project can be done individually or by pair, but not more. Your project shall be made available to me by April 14^{th}, midnight. I highly recommand the output to be a published as a Jupyter Notebooke.g. https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html or a R Markdowne.g. https://rpubs.com/YaRrr/markdownbasics. As a fallback solution, you can send it to me as a pdf: it will be accepted but less well rated. 

As an indication, you might need around 5 hours on the “financial aspects” (reasoning, writing, etc.) and 5 hours on IT related issues (retrieving data, computing statistics, creating graphs, creating notebook, ...)

## Datasets

You can use two datasets:

1.  <a href = "US_stocks_histo_clean.csv">US\_stocks\_histo\_clean.csv</a>:
    a dataset containing 5 years of daily returns of stocks,
    representing 96% of the SP500 index.
2.  <a href = "US_stocks_info_clean.csv">US\_stocks\_info\_clean.csv</a>:
    another dataset containing relevant information about
    those stocks.
